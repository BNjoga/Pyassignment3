## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program defines a function that checks if the discount is at least 20%.
2. The user is asked for:
   - The original price of the item.
   - The discount percentage.
3. The program prints the final price:
   - If discount ≥ 20% → applies the discount.
   - If discount < 20% → no discount applied.

## ▶️ Example Run
